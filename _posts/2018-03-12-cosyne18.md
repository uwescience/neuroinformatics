The Computational and Systems Neuroscience (COSYNE) conference provides a forum for the exchange of
experimental and theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience.

The conference is divided into two main sessions:
- Main meeting (Denver, CO, 1-4 March 2018)
- Workshops (Breckenridge, CO, 5-6 March 2018)


## Tutorial Session

This year, COSYNE was hosting its first tutorial session,
"Statistical models for neural data: from GLMs to latent variables",
held by Prof. Jonathan Pillow (Princeton University).
There were 293 registered for the tutorial, and it was their first COSYNE for [155, 208] (95% CI) participants. 
Slides can be found on his <a href="http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/teaching.html">website</a>.


## Main Meeting

The main meeting consists of a single track featuring both invited and submitted (high-scoring abstracts) talks.
This year saw another record in the number of attendees and submitted abstracts
(857 registrations, 709 abstracts submitted, 396 accepted - 55.8%),
which was increased from 330 accepeted abstracts last year in Salt Lake City, UT
thanks to a bigger venue in Denver.

Lots of presentations were dominated by a dynamical systems view of the brain.
More and more researchers are taking the view that whereas individual neuronal responses are very high-dimensional,
the activity of a population of neurons is usually restricted to a lower-dimensional manifold 
(i.e., a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point) within the
space of all possible population responses.
Hence, lots of presentations were centered around ways to analyze high-dimensional data.
